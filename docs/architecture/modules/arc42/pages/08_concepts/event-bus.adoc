= Guava EventBus: Concept Overview

include::partial$config.adoc[]

The *Guava EventBus*, part of the Google Guava library for Java, implements a *publish-subscribe (pub-sub)* messaging pattern. This design pattern decouples the components that send events (publishers) from those that handle them (subscribers).

== üîÅ Core Concept

The Guava EventBus allows objects to communicate with each other *without being tightly coupled*. Instead of directly calling methods on other objects, an object can *post an event* to the EventBus, and any object that is registered as a *subscriber* to that type of event will automatically receive it.

== üß† Key Features

* *Decoupling*: Publishers don‚Äôt need to know who the subscribers are.
* *Type-based routing*: Events are dispatched to subscribers based on the event's type.
* *Annotation-driven*: Methods that should handle events are annotated with `@Subscribe`.
* *Thread-safe*: Internally synchronized so that multiple threads can safely post events or register subscribers.
* *Synchronous by default*: Event handlers are called in the same thread as the caller that posts the event (can be made async with `AsyncEventBus`).

== üß± Basic Components

=== 1. EventBus Instance

[source,java,opts=novalidate]
----
EventBus eventBus = new EventBus();
----

=== 2. Event Class

[source,java,opts=novalidate]
----
@Builder
@AllArgsConstructor
@Getter
public class UserCreatedEvent {
    private final String username;
}
----

=== 3. Subscriber

[source,java,opts=novalidate]
----
public class UserEventListener {
    @Subscribe
    public void handleUserCreated(UserCreatedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("User created: " + event.getUsername());
    }
}
----

=== 4. Posting an Event

[source,java,opts=novalidate]
----
eventBus.register(new UserEventListener());
eventBus.post(new UserCreatedEvent("Alice"));
----

== ‚ö° Use Cases

* Event-driven applications
* UI updates in response to model changes
* Decoupling business logic from controllers or services
* In-process communication within complex systems
