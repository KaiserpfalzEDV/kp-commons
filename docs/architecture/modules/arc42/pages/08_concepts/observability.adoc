= Observability Concept with Spring Boot, Prometheus, and JSON Logging

include::partial$config.adoc[]

Observability refers to a system‚Äôs ability to provide insights into its internal state by exposing external outputs. It is typically built on three pillars: *Logging*, *Monitoring*, and *Alerting*.

== üîç Logging

Logging captures structured or unstructured information about system events. In a production-ready setup, logs are written in JSON format to facilitate automated processing and analysis.

=== Technology: Spring Boot + JSON Logging

* Use a logging framework such as `Logback` or `Log4j2` with a JSON encoder.
* Example configuration using `Logback` in `logback-spring.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <appender name="JSON_CONSOLE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder" />
  </appender>

  <root level="INFO">
    <appender-ref ref="JSON_CONSOLE" />
  </root>
</configuration>
----

* Example log output:
[source,json]
----
{
  "timestamp": "2025-04-13T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "com.example.MyService",
  "message": "User successfully created",
  "userId": "12345"
}
----

== üìä Monitoring

Monitoring collects metrics (e.g. latency, memory usage, throughput) to continuously observe system performance and health.

=== Technology: Spring Boot Actuator + Prometheus

* `spring-boot-actuator` exposes metrics via the `/actuator/metrics` endpoint.
* Integration with `micrometer` enables Prometheus as a metrics backend.

=== Example configuration (application.yml)

[source,yaml]
----
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: prometheus
  metrics:
    export:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
----

* Prometheus is configured with a `scrape` job to periodically collect metrics:

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring-boot-app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
----

== üö® Alerting

Alerting generates notifications based on defined thresholds in metrics, enabling rapid responses to potential issues.

=== Technology: Prometheus + Alertmanager

* Prometheus evaluates metrics and triggers alerts according to alerting rules.
* Example rule (Prometheus):

[source,yaml]
----
groups:
  - name: spring-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{status=~"5.."}[1m]) > 5
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate detected"
          description: "More than 5 errors per second in the last 60 seconds"
----

* Alertmanager handles routing and escalation (e.g. email, Slack).

== ‚úÖ Summary

The observability setup is composed of the following components:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Component  | Technology
| Logging    | Spring Boot + Logback + JSON
| Monitoring | Spring Boot Actuator + Micrometer + Prometheus
| Alerting   | Prometheus Alert Rules + Alertmanager
|===

This setup provides deep visibility into the system‚Äôs behavior and ensures quick incident response.
