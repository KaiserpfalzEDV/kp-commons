== Context
The default data store for the DCIS is a relational database.
There are different approaches to handle RDBMs in java.

There may be other datastores (so called no-sql).
These are neither handled by this ADR nor forbidden to be used in this project.


== Decision
To handle SQL databases we use JPA.
It is a quite well known standard and well supported within the java ecosystem.
For spring we use the spring-data-jpa framework to handle the low level OR mapping.


== Consequences
1. There is no low level efficiency optimization to our queries.
2. The restrictions of spring-data-jpa apply.
