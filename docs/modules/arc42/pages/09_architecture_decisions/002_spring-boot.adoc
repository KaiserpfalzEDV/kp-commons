== Context
To keep the system maintainable, it should not contain too many different programming languages.
Also the frameworks should be limited and selected in a way, maintenance development can be streamlined.


== Decision
Since we use java as the primary language, the decision was easy to use the spring-boot framework.
Also the integrations of the spring-boot framework and its eco system should be used.
