== Quality Scenarios

[cols="<.<1,<.<9a",options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows"]
|===
| ID | Scenario

|[[FS01,Tailored to Spring Security (FS01)]] **FS01**
|The system is created for integrating into Spring Security.

|[[FS02,Data Protection (FS02)]] **FS02**
|The software needs to conform to the GDPR in Europe.

|[[CO01,Compatible with Keycloak (CO01)]] **CO01**
|The data transfer between keycloak and the system should be possible.

|[[CO02,Compatible with discord (CO02)]] **CO02**
|The system should offer a discord bot to use the data.

|[[US01,Web based (US01)]] **US01**
|The main interface should be web based.

|[[US02,Multi Language (US02)]] **US02**
|The system **has to** be available at least in *German* and *English* language.
Other translations **should** be easily addable.

|[[US03,Fast Response Times (US03)]] **US03**
| Request have to be answered quickly. The following time percentiles are sufficient:
[cols="<.<1,<.<1",width=40%,options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows"]
!===
!Percentage of requests !Response Time
!95%!1,5s
!90%!2s
!75%!2,5s
!50%!4s
!25%!5
!===

|[[RE01,Working hours 24/7 (RE01)]] **RE01**
|Torg Eternity is played around the world. So the systems have to work 24/7. There is no maintenance window available where no users would be affected.

|[[RE02,12 Factor (RE02)]] **RE02**
|Following the guidelines of 'The Twelve-Factor App' {12factor} support the maintainability and resilience of the system.

|[[MT01,Small Team (MT01)]] **MT01**
|Maintaining the software and the data must be possible for a small team (basically the full army of myself, me, and I).
