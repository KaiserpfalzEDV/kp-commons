= Role based access control

include::partial$config.adoc[]

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used security model in IT systems that restricts system access based on the roles assigned to users within an organization.
Instead of assigning permissions directly to individual users, RBAC assigns permissions to roles, and users are then assigned to these roles.


== Key Concepts

Roles:: Defined sets of permissions that correspond to job functions or responsibilities (e.g., "Administrator", "Editor", "Viewer").

Permissions:: Specific rights or privileges to perform actions on resources (e.g., read, write, delete).

Users:: Individuals or entities that are assigned to one or more roles.


== How RBAC Works

Define roles based on organizational needs.
Assign permissions to each role according to the required access level.
Assign users to roles based on their job responsibilities.
Users inherit permissions from their assigned roles.


== Example

=== Roles:

Administrator:: read, write, delete
Editor:: read, write
Viewer:: read

=== User Assignments:

Alice:: Administrator
Bob:: Editor
Carol:: Viewer


== Benefits

Simplifies management of user permissions.
Reduces the risk of excessive or inappropriate access.
Eases compliance with security policies and regulations.
Scales efficiently as organizations grow.


== Summary

RBAC provides a structured and efficient way to manage access control in IT systems by grouping permissions into roles and assigning those roles to users.
This approach enhances security, simplifies administration, and supports organizational policy enforcement.
