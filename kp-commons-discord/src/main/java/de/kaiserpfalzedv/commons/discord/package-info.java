/**
 * Discord -- A not so complete anti-corruption layer.
 *
 * Normally this package should complete encapsulate the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDA} library. But I like the data
 * design and see no value in doubling the classes with wrapper classes.
 *
 * So this library uses the data structures of JDA directly. If JDA is to be replaced, then it is time to do the
 * double work.
