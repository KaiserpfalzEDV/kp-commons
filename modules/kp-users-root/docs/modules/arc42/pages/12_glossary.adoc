|Term |Definition

|12 Factor App
|Some principles how to design a microservice application. Please check {12factor} for further information.

|Agile Manifesto
|The Manifesto for Agile Software Development as published on {agilemanifesto}.

|((AMQP))
|A messaging protocol standard that defines also the wire protocol.
That way the wire protocol is not proprietary which enables cross-organization communication via messaging.

|((Attribute-based access control)) +
((ABAC))
| Attribute-based access control (ABAC), also known as policy-based access control for IAM, defines an access control paradigm whereby a subject's authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some cases, environment attributes.

|((Clean Code))
|Clean Code has been promoted by several books by Robert C. Martin.
A nice website to describe it is {cleancode}.

|((Discord))
|Discord is a (voice) chat.
It started as chat system for video games to support creating and running guilds but evolved in a general chat system with different so called servers for any topic possible.
During the covid pandemic the _TTRPG_ community discovered discord to play games on it.

|((DRY))-Principle (((DRY)))

Needed data is transferred asynchronously and fulfills eventual consistency.
It offers fragments of HTML via HTTP to be included in UIs from other systems.
Please check {scs} for more information.

|((SOLID-Principle)) (((SOLID)))
| In software programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Although the SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.

* **S**ingle responsible principle
* **O**pen-closed principle
* **L**iskov substitution principle
* **I**nterface segregation principle
* **D**ependency inversion principle

|((YAGNI))-Principle (((YAGNI)))
|An architectural principle in software development:
