== Context
{scs} are created to be as independent as possible.
But not to implement certain functions again and again some methods should be implemented only once {mt01}.


== Decision
kp-users are shared libraries for other projects.


== Consequences
. The shared libraries break the concepts of {scs}.
. The SCS may be more dependable on shared code.
. The SCS are fully seperated via data synchronization.
