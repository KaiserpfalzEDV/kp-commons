## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to our email address [Kaiserpfalz EDV-Service Support](mailto:support@kaiserpfalz-edv.de)
and give us two days to respond. We will get in contact with you and discuss the matter. After the two days we have no moral
rights to complain about too early disclosure.

Please keep in mind that "we" always means the full army of me. I do everything I'm capable of to resolve the issues.
