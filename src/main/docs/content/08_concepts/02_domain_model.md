Every submodule contains the domain model for it's domain.
The only exception is [→ the API]({{< relref "../05_buildingblocks/02_1_core.md#API" >}}), which contains some of the models (or parts thereof) for all sub modules of this library and [→ the core]({{< relref "../05_buildingblocks/02_1_core.md#CORE" >}}) which implements the shared part of the submodules.
